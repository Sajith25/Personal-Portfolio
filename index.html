        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Sajith Uthayakumar, and I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. While my academic background is in engineering, I've developed a strong passion for coding and software development. I am excited about the potential of technology to solve complex problems and improve lives.</p>
        <p>During my time in university, I was introduced to programming through courses in MATLAB, and I found myself drawn to the creative and problem-solving aspects of coding. Now, I'm eager to further develop my skills in programming and software development to pursue a career at the intersection of engineering and technology.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, you can find me  you can find me working on DIY projects, tinkering with new gadgets, or enjoying a good book. I'm always eager to learn new things and embrace new challenges.</p></section>
